# OSMnx

**OSMnx** is a Python package that lets you download geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks and any other geospatial entities. You can download and model walking, driving, or biking networks with a single line of code then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with other infrastructure types, amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, speed/travel time, and routing.
